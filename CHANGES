0.74.30
=======

do not strip leading/trailing whitespace from Execute output


0.74.29
=======

-v only means 'verbose' if v has not been used as an abbreviation for some
other argument
remove whitespace from script __doc__ when printing help


0.74.28
=======

Execute: new 'interactive' paramater:
  False  -> only store output
  'echo' -> echo output as soon as feasible (and store)


0.74.26
=======

Execute: raise ExecuteTimeoutError when pty is True and timeout is exceeded;
all Execute*Error now have an attribute, process, that contains the Execute
attempt


0.74.25
=======

Execute: close error pipe when done reading (avoids resource leakage in long-
running processes)


0.74.24
=======

change mail() to not require a server (will attempt to use the server in the
recipients' address) or the port (defaults to 25); also, if message is a
string it will have its To, Cc, and Bcc fields split on comma to determine
recipients; finally, it will return a dictionary of recipients and error
information (if any) -- an empty dict means mail went to everyone
