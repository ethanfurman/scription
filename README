scription

provides basic script services as well as extremely intelligent command-line
parsing to make command-line scripts easier:

  - Script: marks function as main function to call
  - Command: marks function as a subcommand for the script (e.g. add, delete,
    list, etc.)
  - Run: runs the Script function if one is present, or the appropriate
    Command functions specified on the command-line
  - basic usage/help based on Script and Command call signatures

version 0.50 is a backwards-compatible break:
  - KEYWORD is removed
  - MULTI is added, and by default generates a tuple
