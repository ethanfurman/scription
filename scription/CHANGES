Execute
-------

- use timer loop to drive both subprocess and pty instead of signals
- do not strip any output before passwords
- keep Execute as convenience function; actual class changed to Job


0.74.41
=======

change Execute pty default back to False as I encountered issues with
forked processes forking other processes

use signal to provide timeout when pty is False on non-Windows systems;
(Windows systems are out of luck until Python 3.3)

=======

If Execute times out, modify resulting object instead of raising


0.74.38
=======

change Execute pty default on non-Windows systems to True

  False  -> only store output
  'echo' -> echo output as soon as feasible (and store)


0.74.26
=======

Execute: raise ExecuteTimeoutError when pty is True and timeout is exceeded;
all Execute*Error now have an attribute, process, that contains the Execute
attempt


0.74.25
=======

Execute: close error pipe when done reading (avoids resource leakage in long-
running processes)


0.74.24
=======

change mail() to not require a server (will attempt to use the server in the
recipients' address) or the port (defaults to 25); also, if message is a
string it will have its To, Cc, and Bcc fields split on comma to determine
recipients; finally, it will return a dictionary of recipients and error
information (if any) -- an empty dict means mail went to everyone


0.74.23
=======

better usage of docstrings in help output
